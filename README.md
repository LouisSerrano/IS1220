This java project aims at simulating an emergency department of any Hospital, it manages quite well the generation of patients, their arrival at the hospital and their handling throug the different facilities. The core structure of the project is based on a stochastic event simulator. As far as the rest of the code is concerned, because of the deadline, simple methods were implemented. It could be interesting to use different design patterns to improve the quality and the re-usability of the code.
